Let's look at all the 3's as a play, in a single game. This gives us more detail than the simple sheet music visualization shown [last time]({% post_url 2017-01-20-game-music %}). Each of these "plays" are generated by logging all the movement since the last recorded event, which could be a made basket, a rebound, a turnover, or something else. This is the same generation used in the last post, but you can a lot more easily see which plays resulted in open 3's off of a rebound, vs for example a made basket.

**Legend:** Ball: Orange &#124; Spurs: Black &#124; Trailblazers: Red
